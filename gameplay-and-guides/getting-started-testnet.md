# ðŸ’» Getting Started (Testnet)

It is highly recommended that you join the [Degen Dystopia Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jPGmUZ3CJv) for live support getting the game running for the first time.

### 0. Installing a wallet

This tutorial will assume you have MetaMask already installed.&#x20;

If you don't have Metamask installed (or some other Ethereum-compatible wallet) head over to [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io) and install it in your browser or device.

Once it is installed, you should be able to see the metamask icon among your browser's extensions:

Click the icon to see your wallet's contents and address:



### 1. Funding your wallet&#x20;

Once you play on the testnet, first you will need to set up a wallet and fund it with some AVAX from the testnet faucet.&#x20;

Fisrt let's open up our wallet in Metamask:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)

Now let's copy out our wallet's address:

Now head over to [https://faucet.avax-test.network/](https://faucet.avax-test.network). You should see the front end for the Avalanche Testnet Faucet.&#x20;

### 2. Connecting to the game for the first time

Now that our wallet has some funds, we're ready to play! Head over to [https://www.degendystopia.world/Play.html](https://www.degendystopia.world/Play.html).

Once the game loads it will ask you to add the Avalache testnet network to metamask. Click approve:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

The game will then ask you to connect your wallet:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

Select the wallet which has the testnet funds and click Next -> Connect:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Once our wallet is connected to the site, we no longer have to repeat this process.

### 3. Mint your first DEGEN

Next you will see a login screen. Click the button to log in.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

Your signature will be requested in order to prove you are the owner of the connected wallet:

Once you have signed in, you will see the character select screen. If this is your first time playing, you will see no playable characters:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

Click `mint()` to create a playable degen. You will be prompted to name it:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

You will then be prompted to approve the minting transaction by Metamask. Click approve to mint a new DEGEN token:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)

Minting may take several seconds to confirm. When the transaction is successful the pge will refresh and you will be prompted to log in again.

Once you have logged in again, you will see your newly minted DEGEN. you can mint another DEGEN if you wish, or you can get right into the game.

### &#x20;4. Enter the world with your DEGEN

After logging in, simply select the DEGEN you wish to play with, then click the `play()` button:
