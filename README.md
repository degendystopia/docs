_`"Ravaged landscapes stretch out in all directions. Burned-out buildings loom ominously over the alleys of abandoned cities. Corroded droids hunt down travelers foolish enough to wander through their domain. Survivors of long-forgotten wars scavenge together what little they can, in the hopes of forging a new life in this desolate world. Welcome to the Wasteland. Welcome to`**`Degen Dystopia`**`."`_

**Degen Dystopia** is a post-apocalyptic, browser-based MMORPG in which players have full ownership of their assets and the player-run economy.

The game consists of an **Open-World** 2D map in which players can explore, level up their **NFT characters**, <mark style="color:purple;">**collect resources**</mark> (<mark style="color:green;">**ERC-20**</mark>), and <mark style="color:yellow;">**craft items**</mark> (<mark style="color:green;">**ERC-721**</mark>).

Players can <mark style="color:red;">**engage in combat**</mark> with the inhabitants of the **Degen Dystopia** world (PvE) as well as other players (PvP) in real-time to collect and compete for rewards. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Craftable gear**</mark> gives players an edge in combat and survival, and unlocks new abilities and areas of the map to explore.

**Degen Dystopia** features <mark style="color:red;">**Open-PVP Zones**</mark>, where players can kill each other **** and steal each other’s pending rewards. Open-PVP areas are restricted to specific zones <mark style="color:purple;">**rich in token rewards**</mark>, leaving plenty of room for casual players to play and earn, while incentivizing competition and cooperation at the highest levels of play.

The continuous flow between <mark style="color:yellow;">**resource collection**</mark> -> <mark style="color:purple;">**crafting**</mark> -> <mark style="color:red;">**combat**</mark> incentivizes players to specialize their builds, collaborate, and compete in real time for wealth and territory in the persistent world of **Degen Dystopia**.

At our hearts we are gamers. We see, on the one hand, the AAA game industry releasing the same games year after year with little more than visual upgrades. We have seen countless indie games over-promise and under-deliver. Gamers these days are filled with nostalgia for times when quality video games were consistently released by big companies and indie studios alike. We are driven by our passion to provide something original and fun to the gaming community.

Likewise, we are also crypto investors,and developers. Much like in the world of gaming, we have seen many overinflated promises and underwhelming executions (as well as downright scams) in the crypto space. This is especially true when it comes to the loosely-defined spheres of "Crypto Gaming" & "GameFi".&#x20;

At the time of writing, very few crypto projects calling themselves "games" actually have an existing game to be played. Typically these projects are simply gamified frontends for standard DeFi applications (DEX, yield farms, etc.). And out of those who do actually have some kind of playable game, these are usually little more than a cookie-cutter walking simulator cooked up in the likes of RPG Maker with zero actual game play, yet somehow already selling plots of land at 0.5 ETH and up.&#x20;

It seems all anyone talks about these days in regards to crypto and gaming is how much of a "scam" it all is, or at best, how NFTs/crypto are "useless" and "unnecessary" in gaming. We are here to change that.

We believe _good games_ can be made by those willing to break out of the traditional genres. We believe good crypto projects can be made by those willing to put in work and deliver software _before_ asking users to invest their money, time, and energy. We believe the viability of games, as well as economies built on those games, depends on the game actually being fun and engaging for players.

We believe that sustainable MMO game economies can be built. We believe a sustainable in-game economy must be based on the game's ability to deliver an interesting & enjoyable experience to its players. The game must evolve and grow with time, finding new ways to reward veteran players, as well as introduce incentives for new players to interact and invest their time. As demonstrated by games such as Ultima Online, Runescape, EVE Online, and many others, competition and cooperation between players in the pursuit of in-game wealth naturally leads to the creation of player-run economies.&#x20;

We will continue to develop **Degen Dystopia** in accordance with long-term vision. Our community will watch us evolve, steadily and sustainably, delivering real value progressively, avoiding the classic pump-and-dump mechanics that are all too common in the NFT/crypto space.

Through active development of the game, expansion of features such as crafting, tournaments, betting, NFT rental system, minigames, partnerships, and much more, we can continually grow our incentives and rewards for players, attracting both the gamers who want to earn, and the earners who want to play.

We believe strength of any project, especially in gaming and in crypto, is based on the value it can deliver to its users. On top of high quality projects, the strongest communities are formed. We hope to achieve and share this real value and utility with our players and investors, built on a foundation of a unique game that is loads of fun to play.
