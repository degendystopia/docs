            <p>
                DDGOLD is acquired in Degen Dystopia by mining. Mining is a
                semi-passive activity players can do in Degen Dystopia inside of
                mines and caves.
                <br />
                <br />
                DDGOLD is used to craft and upgrade more powerful Dystopians.
                <br />
                <br />
                DDGOLD will be stakeable in vaults which pay out AVAX over time
                in proportion to Degen Dystopiaâ€™s revenue.
            </p>

            <h2 className="h4">Supply</h2>
            <p>
                The DDGOLD token is a fungible token with a fixed supply hard
                cap of 1,000,000.
                <br />
                <br />
                Initially, DDGOLD will begin with 0 circulating supply. The only
                way to obtain DDGOLD will be to play Degen Dystopia with a DEGEN
                and earn by using the DEGEN&apos;s mining ability. Mining skill
                can be buffed by arming your DEGEN with certain DYSTOPIANs.
                <br />
                <br />
                In Phase 2 of the Degen Dystopia roadmap, liquidity pools will
                be unlocked allowing players and speculators to trade DDGOLD on
                the open market.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every DEGEN starts the game with 1 DDGOLD in their inventory.
