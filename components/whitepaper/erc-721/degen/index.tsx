            </div>
            <p>
                The DEGEN is the core token of Degen Dystopia. It represents the
                playable character itself, with its own look, name, and game
                stats. It is a non-fungible token, and owning or renting one is
                required to play the game.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every DEGEN token in the collection comes with its own unique
                randomly generated artwork.
                <br />
                <br />
                Each DEGEN token has a set of stats and abilities that can be
                leveled up by playing the game, and are stored on-chain to allow
                easy transfer of DEGEN tokens between players and across Degen
                Dystopia servers. Leveled-up DEGEN tokens are more powerful in
                the Degen Dystopia game.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every DEGEN token is associated with a unique animated character
                sprite which acts as the playerâ€™s in-game avatar.
            </p>

            <h2 className="h4">Rarity</h2>
            <p>
                Each DEGEN is of either COMMON, RARE, or MYTHIC rarity.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Rarer DEGENS have rarer artwork. MYTHIC
                Degens also get special in-game cosmetic effects such as custom
                particle effects and lighting, allowing players to more easily
                identify the biggest badasses on the server .
            </p>
