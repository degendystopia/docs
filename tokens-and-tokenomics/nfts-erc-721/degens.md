# ðŸ§‘ DEGENs

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5.png)

The DEGEN is the core token of Degen Dystopia. It represents the playable character itself, with its own look, name, and game stats. It is a non-fungible token, and owning or renting one is _required_ to play the game.&#x20;

Every DEGEN token in the collection comes with its own unique randomly generated artwork.

Each DEGEN token has a set of stats and abilities that can be leveled up by playing the game, and are stored on-chain to allow easy transfer of DEGEN tokens between players and across Degen Dystopia servers. Leveled-up DEGEN tokens are more powerful in the Degen Dystopia game.

Every DEGEN token is associated with a unique animated character sprite which acts as the playerâ€™s in-game avatar.

### Rarity

Each DEGEN is of either COMMON, RARE, or MYTHIC rarity.

**NOTE:** Rarer DEGENS have rarer artwork. MYTHIC Degens also get special in-game cosmetic effects such as custom particle effects and lighting, allowing players to more easily identify the biggest badasses on the server :sunglasses::thumbsup:.

### Supply

The number of DEGEN tokens that can be minted at any time is capped according to the minting rules for the current generation.

The first generation of DEGEN tokens have a supply of **999**:

* **900** COMMON DEGENs: for a mint price of 3 AVAX.
* **90** RARE DEGENs: for a mint price of 15 AVAX.
* **9** MYTHIC DEGENs: for a mint price of 150 AVAX.

### Trading

DEGEN tokens will be tradeable on the Degen Dystopia NFT marketplace with a 2% sales tax which pays into the player rewards pool.
