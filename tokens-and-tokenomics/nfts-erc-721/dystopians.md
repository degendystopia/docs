# ðŸ¤– DYSTOPIANs

![](../../.gitbook/assets/6.png)

DYSTOPIAN tokens are the primary craftable item in Degen Dystopia. Players can craft DYSTOPIANs using resources collected in the Degen Dystopia game, or trade them with other players. Players with builds specialized for crafting DYSTOPIANs will produce the most powerful and cost-effective crafts.

Each class of DYSTOPIAN has its own artwork, power level, crafting skill requirements (that the DEGEN must possess in order to craft), and token ingredients

DYSTOPIANs function like robot pets who will fight for the player, mine, craft, and provide other forms of utility such as healing, resurrection, and fast travel. (that the DEGEN owner must spend in order to craft the DYSTOPIAN NFT).

Each player can wield up to 4 DYSTOPIANs at a time on their DEGEN in-game.

DYSTOPIANs can become damaged in combat and require repairs. Repairs may require consuming game resources for certain types of DYSTOPIANs.

DYSTOPIANs level up as they are used, and can be eventually upgraded to more powerful versions for additional crafting costs.

### **Supply**

DYSTOPIAN supply is limited by the availability of tokens used to craft them. Initially, these tokens will consist of DDSCRAP and DDGOLD.&#x20;

New classes of DYSTOPIANS can be introduced later which have custom recipes, including ERC20 tokens that are not native to Degen Dystopia. This can be used to generate player rewards in the form of any supported AVAX-based tokens.

Additional tokens and newer generations of DEGENs will dynamically alter the supply of DYSTOPIANs.
