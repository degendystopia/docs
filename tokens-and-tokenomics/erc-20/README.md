### Degen Dystopia ERC-20 Tokens

ERC20 tokens in Degen Dystopia are issued as player rewards and can be used to craft and trade in-game items.

When Degen Dystopia launches its _Phase 2_ (see [Roadmap](../../roadmap.md)), liquidity pools for its ERC20 tokens will be unlocked with total values equal to the total amount earned by players during Phase 1. This will allow the players to have control over liquidity and reduce the supply available to whales.

At the time of launch, Degen Dystopia features 2 ERC20 tokens for use in the game. These are [DDSCRAP](ddscrap.md) and [DDGOLD](ddgold.md). View their individual pages for more information about them.
