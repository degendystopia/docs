# âš™ DDSCRAP

### **About DDSCRAP** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/scrap.png)****

DDSCRAP is required in all crafting recipes, as well as to repair Dystopians.

DDSCRAP is earned by defeating Dystopians in combat or smelting them down (burning the token) for a refund of the crafting ingredients.

DDSCRAP that is spent on repairs is refunded to the game treasury to sustain player rewards.

### Supply

The DDSCRAP token is a fungible token with a fixed supply hard cap of 100,000,00.

DDSCRAP will also have many deflationary mechanics, including being used for repairs on DYSTOPIANs, crafting & repairing houses,&#x20;

Initially, DDSCRAP will begin with 0 circulating supply. The only way to obtain DDSCRAP will be to play Degen Dystopia with a DEGEN and earn by killing Degens.

In Phase 2 of the Degen Dystopia roadmap, liquidity pools will be unlocked allowing players and speculators to trade DDSCRAP on the open market.
