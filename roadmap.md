# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

![At Degen Dystopia, we believe in developing, testing, and delivering a quality product first and foremost to our audience. We will therefore extensively test Degen Dystopia's gameplay and smart contracts prior to release. Community members who contribute time and energy to help us develop and test will be prioritized for  the issuance of early-adopter incentives, which most projects usually reserve for pump-and-dump "presales".](.gitbook/assets/0.png)

![The initial launch of Degen Dystopia on Avalanche mainnet will give early players the opportunity to begin leveling up their DEGENs, collecting rewards, and forming alliances. From this activity, the on-chain player-run economy will be born. Liquidity for in-game token rewards will remain locked during this phase, giving players the opportunity to accumulate ahead of whales and investors. Don't worry, investors, you will get your chance in Phase 2.      ](.gitbook/assets/1.png)

![The next phase of Degen Development will focus on expanding opportunities for investors to participate in and benefit from the Degen Dystopia economy without needing to actually play the game. A new generation of DEGEN mints will  be unlocked, along with a DEGEN rental system which allows players to play Degen Dystopia and earn rewards without having to mint or buy their own DEGEN. Token liquidity will be unlocked to give players an easy way to convert their in-game gains to AVAX & USDC, while simultaneously opening opportunities for Liquidity Providers to benefit from Degen Dystopia's economy.](<.gitbook/assets/2 (1).png>)

![As Degen Dystopia continues to grow, we will focus on developing features which add sustainability and inflow of revenue into the game's rewards treasury. Betting and tournaments will allow investors and players to compete for prizes while subsidizing the rewards paid out to players. The Housing System of Degen Dystopia will require large sums of in-game housing materials to craft a house which becomes a permanent fixture in the Degen Dystopia landscape. This, along with token fusions will increase demand for Degen Dystopia's resources, opening room for new token mints without creating inflation.](<.gitbook/assets/3 (2).png>)

![Our long-term goal for Degen Dystopia is for our own players to co-create with us, to take ownership not only over their own characters but of the game world itself. By making the Degen Dystopia source code available for any one to run & mod, we believe we can create a decentralized game ecosystem where people can transport their assets across game servers, decreasing reliance on the official Degen Dystopia servers, and allowing new levels of creativity and innovation to be injected into the Degen Dystopia ecosystem through player-created customizations. ](<.gitbook/assets/4 (1).png>)
